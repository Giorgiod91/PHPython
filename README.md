# PHPython

**A Python library that lets you write PHP code in Python style.**  

This project is an experimental library where you can write code using Python syntax and conventions, and it generates valid PHP code.  
I’m currently learning PHP as part of my retraining program and wanted to create a hands-on project to practice both Python and PHP.
